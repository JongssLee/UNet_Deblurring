# UNet based Deblurring

---

### Setting

The Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats dataset, originally designed for binary classification, was repurposed to create a robust image restoration framework.

By artificially introducing Gaussian blur to these high-quality pet images, I established a controlled environment for training and evaluating deblurring algorithms.

This strategic adaptation of the dataset is particularly compelling as it provides a diverse collection of natural images with rich textures, complex features, and varying lighting conditions
